## cisco-webex-bot completion zsh

Generate the autocompletion script for zsh

### Synopsis

Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

	echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

To load completions in your current shell session:

	source <(cisco-webex-bot completion zsh); compdef _cisco-webex-bot cisco-webex-bot

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

#### Linux:

	cisco-webex-bot completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_cisco-webex-bot"

#### macOS:

	cisco-webex-bot completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_cisco-webex-bot

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.


```
cisco-webex-bot completion zsh [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help              help for zsh
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions
```
